    "- Combine all observations from both groups\n",
    "- Replace values with their **ranks**\n",
    "- Compare how ranks are distributed between the two groups\n",

    "If the two groups are similar, their ranks should be mixed. If one group tends to have larger values, it will tend to have larger ranks.\n",

    "- **Test:** Mann–Whitney U test using `scipy.stats.mannwhitneyu`\n",

    "\n",
    "### Decision Rule\n",
    "- If $p > 0.05$ $\\rightarrow$ **Fail to reject $H_0$**: no significant evidence of a difference between groups\n",

    "### Practical Notes\n",
    "- If there are many ties or very small sample sizes, exact p-values or appropriate methods should be used (SciPy handles this depending on settings).\n",
    "- If your primary goal is comparing **medians**, ensure group distributions have similar shape; otherwise interpret the result as a **distribution difference** rather than strictly a median difference.\n"

    "The **Kruskal–Wallis H test** is a **nonparametric** alternative to **one-way ANOVA**. It tests whether **three or more independent groups** come from the same distribution, using **ranks** rather than raw values. It is useful when ANOVA assumptions (especially normality) are violated or when data are ordinal / heavily skewed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Core idea:\n",
    "- Pool all observations from all groups\n",
    "- Convert them to **ranks**\n",
    "- Compare rank distributions across groups\n",
    "\n",
    "If groups are similar, their ranks should be well mixed. If at least one group tends to have higher or lower values, ranks will shift.\n",
    "\n",
    "The test statistic $H$ is computed from group rank sums and (under $H_0$) is approximately Chi-square distributed:\n",

    "where $k$ is the number of groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it tests (important interpretation)**\n",
    "- In general, it tests whether the **distributions differ** across groups.\n",
    "- If group distributions have similar shape/spread, it is often interpreted as a test of **location differences** (e.g., median shifts).\n",
    "\n",
    "A nutrition researcher compares **three different diets** (Diet A, Diet B, Diet C) based on **weight loss** after 8 weeks.  \n",
    "However, weight loss values are skewed and include outliers, so a nonparametric test is preferred.\n",

    "**Research Question**  \n",

    "- **Test:** Kruskal–Wallis H test using `scipy.stats.kruskal`\n",

    "- **Assumptions**\n",
    "  - Observations are independent\n",
    "  - Outcome is at least ordinal (ranking is meaningful)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tail Type\n",
    "This test is effectively **right-tailed** because:\n",
    "- $H \\ge 0$\n",
    "- larger $H$ indicates greater rank separation between groups\n",

    "### Decision Rule\n",
    "- If $p > 0.05$ $\\rightarrow$ **Fail to reject $H_0$**: no significant evidence of differences among groups\n",
    "- If $p \\le 0.05$ $\\rightarrow$ **Reject $H_0$**: evidence that at least one group differs\n",

    "The **Friedman test** is a **nonparametric** alternative to **Repeated Measures ANOVA**.  \n",
    "It tests whether there are differences among **3+ related conditions/time points** measured on the **same subjects**, using **within-subject ranks** rather than assuming normality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Core idea:\n",
    "- For each subject, rank that subject’s measurements across conditions ($1=$ smallest, $\\dots$)\n",
    "- Sum ranks for each condition across subjects\n",
    "- If conditions are similar, rank sums should be close; if one condition tends to be higher/lower, rank sums will differ\n",
    "\n",
    "The Friedman test statistic is typically denoted $Q$ (or sometimes $\\chi_F^2$). Under $H_0$, it is approximately Chi-square distributed:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Q \\approx \\chi^2_{k-1},\n",

    "\n",
    "Reaction times are not normally distributed and include outliers, so a nonparametric repeated-measures test is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Research Question**  \n",
    "> Do the typical reaction times differ across the three phases when the same athletes are measured repeatedly?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hypotheses\n",
    "- **$H_0$ (Null):** The distributions of the repeated measurements are the same across conditions  \n",
    "  *(no systematic within-subject rank differences; conditions perform similarly).*\n",
    "- **$H_1$ (Alternative):** At least one condition differs  \n",
    "  *(within-subject ranks are not balanced across conditions).*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Test Setup\n",
    "- **Test:** Friedman test using `scipy.stats.friedmanchisquare`\n",
    "- **Significance level:** $\\alpha = 0.05$\n",
    "- **Data structure:** Each subject has one measurement per condition/time point (paired across all conditions)\n",
    "- **Assumptions**\n",
    "  - Observations are paired/repeated on the same subjects\n",
    "  - Outcome is at least ordinal (ranking is meaningful)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tail Type\n",
    "This test is effectively **right-tailed** because:\n",
    "- the Friedman statistic satisfies $Q \\ge 0$\n",
    "- larger values indicate greater differences in rank sums across conditions\n",
    "- the p-value is computed from the **upper tail** of a Chi-square distribution (approximately)\n",
    "\n",
    "So we reject $H_0$ when $ \\ p \\le \\alpha$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Decision Rule\n",
    "- If $p > 0.05$ $\\rightarrow$ **Fail to reject $H_0$**: no significant evidence of differences across conditions\n",
    "- If $p \\le 0.05$ $\\rightarrow$ **Reject $H_0$**: evidence that at least one condition differs\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What the Code Produces / Reports\n",
    "- Friedman test statistic $Q$\n",
    "- p-value\n",
    "- A conclusion comparing p-value to $\\alpha$\n",
    "- (Optional) If significant: post-hoc pairwise comparisons (Wilcoxon signed-rank) with multiple-comparison correction\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practical Notes\n",
    "- Friedman tells you **that** a difference exists, not **which conditions** differ.\n",
    "- Follow up with pairwise **Wilcoxon signed-rank** tests (with Holm/Bonferroni correction) to locate differences.\n",

    "## Logistic Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "**Logistic regression** is a statistical classification method used when the **target (response) variable is categorical**, most commonly **binary** (e.g., 0/1, No/Yes, Fail/Pass). It models the relationship between one or more predictors and the **probability** of belonging to a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use Logistic Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Use logistic regression when:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The outcome variable is **binary** (e.g., `is_Recovery ∈ {0,1}`), or can be extended to **multiclass**.\n",
    "- Predictors can be **continuous**, **categorical** (after encoding), or mixed.\n",
    "- You want **interpretable effects** (via odds ratios).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Idea\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $Y \\in \\{0,1\\}$ be a binary outcome and $\\mathbf{x} = (x_1,\\dots,x_p)$ be predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic regression models the conditional probability:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p(\\mathbf{x}) = P(Y=1 \\mid \\mathbf{x})\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of modeling $p(\\mathbf{x})$ directly with a line, it models the **log-odds (logit)** as a linear function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\log\\!\\left(\\frac{p(\\mathbf{x})}{1 - p(\\mathbf{x})}\\right)\n",
    "= \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\cdots + \\beta_p x_p\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Solving for $p(\\mathbf{x})$ gives the **sigmoid** (logistic) function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p(\\mathbf{x}) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp\\left(-(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\cdots + \\beta_p x_p)\\right)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Decision Rule (Classification)\n",
    "\n",
    "To convert probability to a class prediction:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\hat{y} =\n",
    "\\begin{cases}\n",
    "1, & \\text{if } p(\\mathbf{x}) \\ge \\tau \\\\\n",
    "0, & \\text{if } p(\\mathbf{x}) < \\tau\n",
    "\\end{cases}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- $\\tau$ is a threshold, commonly $\\tau = 0.5$, but it can be adjusted (especially with imbalanced data).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpreting Coefficients (Odds Ratio)\n",
    "\n",
    "A coefficient $\\beta_j$ represents how $x_j$ affects the **log-odds** of $Y=1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **odds ratio** for a one-unit increase in $x_j$ is:\n",

    "\n",
    "Unlike linear regression (least squares), logistic regression estimates parameters by **Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "For $n$ observations $(\\mathbf{x}_i, y_i)$, the likelihood is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, we maximize the **log-likelihood**, often with numerical optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Regularization (Optional but Common)\n",
    "\n",
    "To prevent overfitting (especially with many features), logistic regression often includes regularization:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **L2 (Ridge):** penalizes $\\sum_j \\beta_j^2$\n",
    "- **L1 (Lasso):** penalizes $\\sum_j |\\beta_j|$ (can yield sparse coefficients)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assumptions and Practical Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic regression works best when:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Observations are **independent**.\n",
    "- Predictors are not extremely **multicollinear**.\n",
    "- The relationship between predictors and the **log-odds** is approximately linear.\n",
    "- Outliers and strong leverage points are checked (can distort coefficients).\n",
    "- For categorical predictors, proper **encoding** (e.g., one-hot) is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Evaluation (Common Metrics)\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification, evaluate with:\n",

    "- **Accuracy**\n",
    "- **Precision / Recall / F1-score**\n",
